"""

Problem is regarding buying and selling shares
If I buy share at less price and sell it at more price 
then I make a profit is the concept used here

print(maxProfit(prices))

#First problem here is find minimum in that array first 
#min(min_price, price)
#iter 1: min(inf, 7) == 7 
#iter 2: min(7, 1)==1
#iter 3: min(1, 5 )==1
#iter 4: min (1,3)==1
#iter 5: min(1,6)==1 and so on hence at the end min is one

# we dont calculate min of entire array and store that because in that way 
# we will get 7-1 = 6 in profit which we donot want
